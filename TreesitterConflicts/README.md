This collection of classes determines the conflicts that will be reported
by Treesitter after disambiguation classes are removed from Copper. 
This is required as Treesitter elects to use GLR parsing to handle ambiguities
while Copper uses disambiguation classes.

To use this by hand run `./build grammar.js xmlDumpFile` where 
 - `grammar.js` is the `grammar.js` file generated by running Silver with the --treesitter-spec flag.
 - `xmlDumpFile` is the XML dump generated by Copper when running Copper on the `modified_copper.xml` file generated by running Silver with the --treesitter-spec flag.

However, this should never need to be done by hand.
