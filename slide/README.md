# Slide
Slide stands for Specification Language for IDEs. Slide is written in Silver
and works with languages written in Silver. Slide provides a syntax for specifying
"properties" of how IDEs should handle your language.
###  Running Slide
Slide is included with this `silver-ide` directory. Running the `build-everything` script in the home directory will do everything that is necessary to initally build Slide. After this, the `slide` command should be part of your path. Calling slide works as follows.

`slide [-I paths to specs] [command line options] ideInterfaceFile`

where `ideInterfaceFile` is generated by calling Silver with the `--ide-interface` flag.
#### Command Line Options
- `-I <path>`:
Instructs Slide to look for specification files in the specified directory. Can be included more than once to specify multiple directories.
- `--ext <ext>`: Tells Slide that slide files end with the specified extension. This is useful for developing multiple IDE specifications for a single language and using different extensions to differentiate between them.
The MELT group uses this feature to develop a regular IDE specification and a demo IDE specification.


### Syntax
All IDE specification files contain one or more specifications. A specification
is started using

`ide_specification for grammar_name {
 ...
}`

or

`global ide_specification {
  ...
}`

The difference between these is that `ide_specification for grammar_name` builds a specification for a specific grammar
 while `global ide_specification` is meant for global properties of the entire language not specifically tied to a particular grammar.

Inside the specification, you specify the IDE "properties" you want on terminals, nonterminals and lexer classes using the following syntax.
```
terminal tName {
  property1 = value1;
  property2 = value2;
};
nonterminal ntName {
  prop = val;
};
lexer class lcName {
  property = value;
};
```
#### Properties
##### Global Properties
These properties are allowed within the `global ide_specification {...}` property specification.
  - `language_name = name`: The name of your language
  - `file_extensions = [ext1, ext2, ...]`: The file extensions
  - `treesitter_parser = @scope/parser_name`: The name of the Treesitter parser. This needs to start with @ have a / and not contain any capital letters.

##### For Terminals, Nonterminals and Lexer Classes
These properties are valid to be used within terminals, nonterminals and lexer classes.

 - `atomMarkupName = name`: The name can be any of the following names provided under section 12.4 in the naming conventions section of this [article](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars.html).
